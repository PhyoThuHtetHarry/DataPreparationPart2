I want like to introduce the flavour of Machine Learning and Data Science. One of them is data preparation. It is so crucial.
Without data preparation on raw datas, the model will work well accurately. It would be like grabage in garbage out without data preparation
although .You may use the most sophisticated alogrithm.
Explore the flavor of Data Preparation here. In this u can also find aggregating data, Using log fuction to become more linear of the data and so on.
Hey! This is your Time.
